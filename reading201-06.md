# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM
## problem domain
 * programing is easy if you understand the problem domain. 
 * we can make th eproblem domian easier  by breaking it down to smaller problems.
 * to make programing easier we can do one of two things:
    1. simplify the problem domain
    2. get better at understanding the problem domain.
## Object Literals

* objects are things that we can specify by there charecters in real world
* variables are called properties and funcitons are call methods
* we assign values by the ":" and seperate functions and properties by a ","
* to access propteries inside an object we write the object name followed by the prooperty seperated by a "."
## Document Object Model
* the browser sees the page as a DOM tree
* DOM trees contain elemnt nodes, document nodes, attribute nodes and text nodes.
* we can select elemnt nodes by id or class attributes.
an element node can contain nultiple text nodes and child element nodes
