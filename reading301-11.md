| Relational Databases (RDBMS)     |    non-relational or distributed database.  |
| table based databases    his means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas   | are document based   key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.  |
| SQL databases have predefined schema whereas   |     have dynamic schema for unstructured data.  |
| vertically scalable    |   databases are horizontally scalable    |
| scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware      |    increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load  |

### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
* If your data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined
### Give a real world example.
* sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records.
### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?Give a real world example.
* the unstructured data;
* data from molecular modeling, Geo-spatial information, and satellite data are highly unstructured. Likewise, data from social media analysis and websites is also highly unstructured, and relationships among the data entities are not clearly defined. In such scenarios, NoSQL is a better choice


###  Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
SQL

###  Which type of database is best for scalability?
NoSQL

## sql vs nosql


### What does SQL stand for?
* structured query language.
### What is a realational database?
* how data base elemens deal with each other. one to one, one to many, many to many.
### What type of structure does a relational database work with?


* tables
### What is a ‘schema’?

* a strict specific way of sorting data inside the tables.
### What is a NoSQL database?

*  a database build to store a lot of data. 
### Howo does it work?

* it has no schema.so it is flixable. generally there are no relations in noSQL world.
### What is inside of a Mongo database?

* collections
### Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

*Mongo db becase it has no schema and no relations. 
### What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
* data is not organized. NoSQL databases don’t have the reliability functions which Relational Databases
