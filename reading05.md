## What is *Java script*
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript) is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.
## *Java script* data types
* The String Data Type
* The Number Data Type
* The Boolean Data Type
* The Undefined Data Type
## *JavaScript* Conditional Statements
* The if statement
> if(condition) {
    // Code to be executed}
* The if...else statement
>if(condition) {
    // Code to be executed if condition is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if condition is false
}

* The if...else if....else statement
>if(condition1) {
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if(condition2) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if both condition1 and condition2 are false
}
