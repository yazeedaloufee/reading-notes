## Domain Modeling
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.

Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models.

* When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
* Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
* Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
* Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
* Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
* Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

## Functions, Methods, and Objects
* Functions allow you to group a set of related 
statements together that represent a single task. 
* Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required 
to do their job) and may return a value. 
* An object is a series of variables and functions that 
represent something from the world around you. 
* In an object, variables are known as properties of the 
object; functions are known as methods of the object.
