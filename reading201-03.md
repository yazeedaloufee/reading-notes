## ***HTML***

## ***Semantics***

### ***Semantics in JavaScript***
In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <li> element with that string as its textContent. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')?

### ***Semantics in CSS***
In CSS, consider styling a list with li elements representing different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with div > ul > li, or .fruits__item?

### ***Semantics in HTML***

In HTML, for example, the element h 1 is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."

><h1>This is a top level heading</h1>
