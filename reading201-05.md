# Readings : Images, Color, Text
## Images 
many reasons can be thought of to use images on a site like: illustration, a logo or a diagram.
having one background for images with similar purpose facilitates browsing.
it is best pracitce to create a file that includes all the images that the site use 
### How to add images to pages
we should use the < img> tag carrying the attributes src ,alt and sometimes title.
> "< img src="" alt=""><br>

* we can also use width and height as attributes but css is used more to specify these.

* we can align images left or right using the attribute algin in older versions of html.
### Choosing the right format
there are 3 rules to creating pictures.
1. make sure you have the right format
2. save them at the right size
3. use the right resolution

### Optimizing images for the web
Images often take longer to 
load than the HTML code that 
makes up the rest of the page. 
It is, therefore, a good idea to 
specify the size of the image 
so that the browser can render 
the rest of the text on the page 
while leaving the right amount of 
space for the image that is still 
loading.
 * Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or 
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.
## Color
* the colour of a page can have a significant effect on audience reaction.
*  we can use RGB values, hex codes, and color names to choose a colour in css.
* using sites such as colour hunt can be helpful when choosing a colour.
* the contrast between the background and the text is essential to have for the users to able to read content on the site.
* css3 uses RBGA and HSLA to indicate opacity
## Text 
* There are properties to control the choice of font, size, 
weight, style, and spacing.
*  There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume 
most people will have installed.
* If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are 
several options, but you need to have the right license 
to use them.
* You can control the space between lines of text, 
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned 
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be 
indented.
* You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an 
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or 
when they have visited a link
## JPEG vs PNG vs GIF

we use JPEG when the picture has a lot of different colours. 
we use png or gif when the picutres has wide areas of the same colour. or they are black and white.
