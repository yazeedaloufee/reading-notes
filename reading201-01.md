***summary about strucrures***<br>
HTML pages are text documents.
X HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled 
brackets) to give the information they surround special 
meaning.
X Tags are often referred to as elements.
X Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes 
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes 
the end.
X Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more 
about the content of that element.
X Attributes require a name and a value.
X To learn HTML you need to know what tags are 
available for you to use, what they do, and where they 
can go
